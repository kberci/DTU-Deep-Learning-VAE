## Description
This project is the implementation of a variational auto-encoder used to generate midi music data. 
The dataset used to train the model is the MAESTRO set, which contains a couple hunder hours of piano music stored in the MIDI format. 
The VAE modelâ€™s encoder and decoder are implemented as LSTM modules which are able to remember past information as they train on the songs. 
A custom dataloader is implemented which randomly batches the songs to train on, but sequentially samples the time sequence from these selected songs.
